Let’s walk important layers.creating graph ggplot, begin mapping data aesthetic properties. uninitiated, may sound like complete nonsense. means use things like x y axis, color, size (aka aesthetic properties) represent variables.Let’s use data make concrete. 10 (1,700 total) rows data gapminder dataset made famous Swedish TODO: add background Hans Rosling (TODO: cite).want make chart, need first decide variable use put x axis put y axis.

Well, replace geom_point() geom_line().(now ’re really getting fancy), add geom_point() geom_line()? line chart points!can extend idea , swapping geom_col() create bar chart.hope ’re seeing ggplot direct implementation Wilkinson’s grammar graphics. difference line chart bar chart isn’t great. can aesthetic properties (namely, putting year x axis life expectancy y axis), simply use different geometric objects visually represent data.return drought data viz, let’s look additional layers can help us can alter bar chart. Let’s say want change color bars. grammar graphics approach chart-making, means mapping variable aesthetic property fill (slightly confusingly, aesthetic property color , bar chart, change outline bar). way mapped year x axis y lifeExp, can also map fill variable. Let’s try mapping fill year variable.see now , earlier years, fill darker later years, lighter (legend, added right plot, shows ). want change fill color? , use scale function. case, ’ll use scale_fill_viridis_c() function (c end function name refers fact data continuous). function, just one many functions start scale_ can alter fill scale, changes default palette one colorblind-friendly prints well grayscale.Another layer can use theme layer. layer allows us change overall look--feel plots (think: plot backgrounds, gridlines, etc). Just number scale_ functions, also number functions start theme_. , ’ve added theme_minimal(), go-theme, gives us much streamlined look.adding theme_minimal() massively improves plot, bar chart anything put forward high-quality data visualization. , least, ’ve seen building chart ggplot involves working multiple layers:First, select variables map aesthetic properties x y axis, color/fill, etcSecond, choose geometric object (aka geom) want use represent dataThird, want change aesthetic properties (example, using different palette), scale_ functionFourth, use theme_ function set overall look--feel plot., course, just scratching surface possible ggplot. many ways improve plot. rather improving ugly plot, let’s instead return drought data viz Cédric Scherer Georgios Karamanis made.
