In 2021, [data from National Drought Mitigation Center showed that nearly all of the American West was in a drought](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/TimeSeries.aspx). By April of that year, [officials in Southern California declared a water emergency](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/west-climate-change-water/), citing unprecedented conditions. 

This wouldn't have come as news to those living in California and other Western states. In addition to the direct impact of drought (leading areas of California to implement water use restrictions), people could see the indirect impact of drought in increased wildfires. With forests dried out by years of drought conditions, wildfires became more frequent, filling skies in the West and beyond with smoke. 

While people could see that drought conditions had increased, communicating the extent of this change remained challenging. How do you show the increase in droughts in a way that accurately represents the data while is also compelling enough to have lay people take notice? 

This was the challenge that CÃ©dric Scherer and Georgios Karamanis took on in November 2021. Commissioned by Scientific American to create a data visualization to highlight the extent to which droughts in the United States have become common, they turned to the ggplot2 package to provide them the tools to turn data on droughts into an impactful visualization. 

They used data from National Drought Center
