In the spring of 2021, [nearly all of the American West was in a drought](https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/DmData/TimeSeries.aspx). In April of that year, [officials in Southern California declared a water emergency](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/west-climate-change-water/), citing unprecedented conditions. 

This wouldn't have come as news to those living in California and other Western states. In addition to the direct impact of drought (leading areas of California to implement water use restrictions), people could see the indirect impact of drought in the skies. With forests dried out by years of drought conditions, wildfires became more frequent, filling the air throughout the West with smoke. 

TODO: Add personal story

Drought conditions like those in the West in 2021 are becoming increasingly common. Yet still, communicating the extent of problem is a challenge. How can we show the data in a way that accurately represents the data while is also compelling enough to get people to take notice? 

This was the challenge that data visualization designers Cédric Scherer and Georgios Karamanis took on in November 2021. Commissioned by the magazine Scientific American to create a data visualization of drought conditions in the last two decades in the United States, they turned to the `ggplot2` package to turn what could be (pardon the pun) dry data into a visually arresting and impactful graph.

There was nothing unique about the data that Cédric and Georgios used. It was the same data from the National Drought Center that news organizations used in their stories. But Cédric and Georgios visualized the data in a way that it both grabs attention and communicates clearly the scale of the phenomenon.

Below is a section of the final visualization. Showing four regions over the last two decades, the increase in drought conditions, especially in California and the Southwest, is made apparent.
