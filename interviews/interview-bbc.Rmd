# Personal Backgrounds

## When did you start using R?

## What changed when you moved to R? 

# Background on bbplot + BBC Visual and Data Journalism cookbook for R graphics

## You've written about how, before you created bbplot, you had to bring in the design team to finish graphs created in R. Talk me through what that looked like for a single graph. 

## The bbc_style() function doesn't give a lot of flexibility to make changes to it. Was this intentional? If so, why?

## You've written that bbplot also spurred interest in others in learning R. What do you attribute this to? 

# Code walkthrough

## bbc_style()

https://github.com/bbc/bbplot/blob/master/R/bbc_style.R

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
library(bbplot)

penguins %>% 
  count(island) %>% 
  mutate(pct = n / sum(n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = island,
           y = pct,
           fill = island)) +
  geom_col() +
  bbc_style()
```

# Wrapping up

## What advice do you have for someone thinking about making a custom theme for their organization?
