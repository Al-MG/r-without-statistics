## My own uncertainty about the way I use R

For the longest time, I felt TK about the way I use R. I use R, a tool designed for statistical analysis, 

don't use it for complex statistical analysis. I don't do machine learning. 

I use R for three main things:

### My background as an anthropologist

### Never used R in grad school

### I only use R for descriptive stats, data viz, and RMarkdown

## But then I realized what people get most excited about is:

Interview with Sharla (statistician who doesn't do complex stats)
- Her rstudio::conf talk


Data viz (illuminate)

Websites (communicate)

Workflow (i.e. automate)

Everyone needs to:

1. Illuminate
2. Communicate
3. Automate

## R started out as a tool for stats, now it does much more than that

It was a niche language by statisticians for statisticians, now it's used by millions for a huge range of purposes. 

## So if R is a general purpose language, why use it versus any other language?

Gives you data stuff first, then you can add on everything else

Remove this section? Too defensive?

## Book title is not to be taken literally
