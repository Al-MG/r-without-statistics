Overall message: bbplot allows people to make plots that are on-brand, but that's not the full story. The creation of bbplot is a story of how technical tools changed the culture, removed bottlenecks, and allowed people to be more creative.

1. How bbplot and cookbook came to be
	1. In 2018 people decided to start learning R at BBC. It changed the way they work by democratizing data viz.
	2. They saw what a data scientist was doing and that inspired them to learn R for analysis
	3. They then realized that they could use it for data viz as well
	4. They previously used Excel and Chart Tools.
		5. They could use chart tools but this was very rigid in what it could produce
		1. They had designers who would make viz from Excel mockups, but this took forever
		3. Nassos: "And then we would sort. Work with a designer or someone who's a bit more specialist on the design side of things and export something for them. And then they would make it sing really and work on it. And, but that is just a very time consuming workflow. If you think how many kind of basic charts or how many visualizations you want to like the BBC does, especially another thing to bear in mind with the BBC is there's 40 odd world service languages as well, who also kind of reversion things."
		4. Nassos: "Thinking back, it was workflow issues that were like, there has to be a better way, rather than us working in our,  doing the analysis, doing the visualizations as exploratory data visualizations, exporting as a PDF, then getting it to someone in illustrator who would then spend time cleaning that up."
	3. Working in ggplot made them more creative because they didn't constantly have to have designer create things and slow their flow down
		4. Clara: "Yeah, I was thinking about this, cuz I definitely found it like immediately addictive when I started working with ggplot to make charts, like even before we got anywhere near having a production ready chart, just trying things out, visualizing things for the first time. And I was trying to work out why. That was, and I think it is that, that you were saying that you can make like the simplest chart with just a couple of lines of code and you've got something that's just there. And then you realize that like the possibilities to tweak, this are limitless. Like I can do anything now.  and you can go as in depth, as you want, just moving things, moving the tiniest things around and you. Just completely flexible in a way that was just completely new to me. Coming from, having worked with chart tools basically previously to, to visualize things."


2. Code
	3. Text formatting
	4. Legend
	5. Axes
	6. Grid lines
	7. Backgrounds (panel and strip)


3. Conclusion
	4. It was all very gradual (not one big moment)
		5. Learned small things (e.g. font sizes, making footer consistent size)
		6. Learned to make packages
		7. Nassos: "The starting point was, yeah, I think the starting point was literally, can we do make a production ready graphic that does not need to go. It does not need any modifications that can go straight from our, onto the BBC website."
		7. Clara: "I don't think that any of it was oh, this is like this one big light bulb moment where we brought it forward. It was just constantly making little fixes and taking the next step."
		8. Clara: " guess the thing that I would have to say based on our experiences is to see the value of and not be afraid to experiment and just not to be afraid to to just sort. Of try things out and that it's okay if you don't have a huge plan from day one with everything set in stone and thinking, okay, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna do all these things. I'm gonna make this package. You can just start by just being curious, just having this one little problem that you have to solve and, go going. Okay. I figured that out. What would be the next step to improve? And then one day maybe, you go on from there, you solve the nice problem."
	7. Implementing the theme enabled the BBC data journalism team to do more
		8. Didn't have to go to designers
		9. Could also explore more on their own
	10. This all (as well as cookbook) spurred additional interest in R at BBC
		11. "Another key benefit of creating production-ready graphics using ggplot2 was not something we necessarily planned for when we set off down this route. Positive reactions from colleagues from other parts of the team led us to develop a six-week course internally, to get people up to speed with the very basics of using R and making graphics using bbplot and the cookbook." - [source](https://medium.com/bbc-visual-and-data-journalism/how-the-bbc-visual-and-data-journalism-team-works-with-graphics-in-r-ed0b35693535)
		12. Nassos: "So I think that kind of spurred people a lot people outside kind of the data journalism team itself to take a real interest and kind of continue, keep on going because there is that, here's what I will produce at the end of it."
	13. Culture of learning is important
		14. Clara: "I think that what helped me, get started with it then was that there was just a really supportive environment at the BBC for learning internally."
	15. During pandemic, R was used all the time to make data viz
		16. Nassos: "It's something that just happens cuz it's all there."
