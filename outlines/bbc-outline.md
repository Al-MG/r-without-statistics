Overall message: how technical tools changed the culture, removed bottlenecks, and allowed people to be more creative

# To classify
- They started off using R just for analysis, viz came later
- Clara: "I think that what helped me, get started with it then was that there was just a really supportive environment at the BBC for learning internally."
- Clara: "I don't think that any of it was oh, this is like this one big light bulb moment where we brought it forward. It was just constantly making little fixes and taking the next step."
- Nassos: "The starting point was, yeah, I think the starting point was literally, can we do make a production ready graphic that does not need to go. It does not need any modifications that can go straight from our, onto the BBC website."
- Nassos: "So it helped benefit both sides. It freed up and it has freed up designers to do much more creative and much more illustrative stuff, as opposed to recreating charts all day."

# Outline
1. They had designers who would make viz
	2. This took forever
	2. "Thinking back, it was workflow issues that were like, there has to be a better way, rather than us working in our,  doing the analysis, doing the visualizations as exploratory data visualizations, exporting as a PDF, then getting it to someone in illustrator who would then spend time cleaning that up."
	3. Working in ggplot made them more creative because they didn't constantly have to have designer create things and slow their flow down
		4. Clara: "Yeah, I was thinking about this, cuz I definitely found it like immediately addictive when I started working with ggplot to make charts, like even before we got anywhere near having a production ready chart, just trying things out, visualizing things for the first time. And I was trying to work out why. That was, and I think it is that, that you were saying that you can make like the simplest chart with just a couple of lines of code and you've got something that's just there. And then you realize that like the possibilities to tweak, this are limitless. Like I can do anything now.  and you can go as in depth, as you want, just moving things, moving the tiniest things around and you. Just completely flexible in a way that was just completely new to me. Coming from, having worked with chart tools basically previously to, to visualize things."
		5. Clara: " guess the thing that I would have to say based on our experiences is to see the value of and not be afraid to experiment and just not to be afraid to to just sort. Of try things out and that it's okay if you don't have a huge plan from day one with everything set in stone and thinking, okay, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna do all these things. I'm gonna make this package. You can just start by just being curious, just having this one little problem that you have to solve and, go going. Okay. I figured that out. What would be the next step to improve? And then one day maybe, you go on from there, you solve the nice problem."
