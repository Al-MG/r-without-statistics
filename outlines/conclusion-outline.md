> R’s relatively strong female representation for a programming language is largely because it is popular in the social sciences and earth sciences, subject areas where women are more likely obtain degrees than in computer science. R is not much used by computer scientists because it was developed specifically for statistics, not as a general-purpose programming language, like Python or Ruby. This gives R a leg up in terms of gender diversity.
