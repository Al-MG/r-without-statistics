1. COVID arrives in rest of world, NZ watches
2. NZ had system in place with R
3. Describe team
	4. Team was 5 or 6 at any time
3. Describe what NZ did with R exactly
	1. Case reports came in from across country
	2. Daily reports on cases
		1. Make sure cases hadn't been reported previously
		2. Separate out cases from abroad vs community spread
			1. Merge with data on international arrivals
4. Reporting:
	1. High-level people text at 9am
	2. All government people situation report with charts and tables at 11am
		1. Was a Word doc, but some content was copied from R into Word (so not 100% automated)
	3. Public briefing at 1pm
		1. Put data from R into web tables manually
5. Reporting requirements changed each day and R made this possible
	1. With something like Tableau or Excel, back-end changes require a lot of front-end work changes as well
6. Additional benefits
	7. People burned out and left and R code enabled others to come in and pick up slack:
		1. "And so there was, there was turnover quite particularly at kind at key moments. And having for someone come in who had understanding of you down and that sure. There's no errors. People can pick that quickly, whereas if you were having would've a harder. So I think that kinda. The most things written down in code and being RUNC with small changes where it needed and lots of error checks is what I mean by the, yeah. Think that, just that flexibility. And then over, over time we add, we added whole workflow, moved into git"
	2. People came in with no R experience and picked it up after shadowing someone for a week
	8. R facilitated collaboration
9. Classic example of using R for reproducibility
	10. It's not complex stats, it's counting
