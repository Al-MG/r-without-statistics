# Intro

- Scenario where someone does survey and goes from SPSS > Excel > Word, but then you have to redo report every month

# How RMarkdown Works

- Contrast RMarkdown with typical workflow: in Rmd, data is fungible (add Jenny Bryan if you liked it meme) whereas with Excel/Word, data is what matters most (see also https://rmd4pharma.netlify.app/static/slides/01-rmd-anatomy.html#11)
- Export to multiple formats (HTML, PDF, and Word most common but also others)

## Pieces of an RMarkdown document

### YAML


### Text

It's the markdown in RMarkdown

- Regular text
- Headers
- Bold/italics
- Lists

Mention RStudio visual editor

### Code

Code chunks

Chunk options

Make plot

Make table

You can run individual chunks to test them along the way

### Inline R code

### Knitting

Knit early and often to find out what's wrong

> I, for me, I try to instill in new users a philosophy of, uh, knit early and knit often - Alison

Have to have things in order

# Quarto

If you learn Rmd, easy to learn Quarto

Small differences in syntax, but same idea


# Conclusion

RMarkdown is reproducibility

> The whole point is that you preserve the source and you save the source and you, uh, you edit that and then you can Reinder when you need to. And that's that reproducibility. - Alison Hill interview

- Need to change mindset when working with Rmd

> And I think the. The answer to that is really more like, I think as you learn this, your ideas start to expand about what you can do and what you can make and what your job actually entails. So for me, being able to start using this tool chain and these toolkits really helped me to be able to grow in my career to be able to say like, oh, okay, well now, like, you know, we need this thing, oh, I can make a website or, oh, I can, you know, make this thing that people can interact with.

> Um, so it helped me to be more creative and open with myself about things that I could do and make, um, that maybe before I would've just kind of noted them as a problem, but I wouldn't have had any kind of proactive thing to do about them. So I, I hope that it ends up being an empowering toolkit for a lot of people to be able to think to themselves like, okay, my organization needs this thing.
