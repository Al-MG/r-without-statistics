# Create Your Own R Package {#packages-chapter}

This chapter discusses how to make your own R functions and packages. You’ll learn how to define your own functions, including the parameters they should accept. Then you’ll create a package, add code and dependencies to it, write its documentation, and choose the license under which to release it.  

Saving your code as functions and then distributing these functions in packages can have numerous benefits. First, packages make your code easier for others to use. For example, when researchers at the Moffitt Cancer Center needed to access code from a database, data scientists Travis Gerke and Garrick Aden-Buie used to write R code for each researcher, but they quickly realized they were reusing the same code over and over. Instead, they made a package with functions for accessing databases. Now researchers no longer had to ask for help. They could install the package Gerke and Aden-Buie had made and use its functions themselves.

What’s more, developing packages allows you to shape how others work. Say you make a ggplot theme that follows the principles of high-quality data visualization discussed in Chapter \@ref(data-viz-chapter). If you put this theme in a package, you can give others an easy way to follow these principles. Functions and packages can help you work with others using shared code.

## Creating Your Own Functions {-}

Hadley Wickham, developer of the tidyverse set of packages, recommends creating a function once you’ve copied some code three times. Functions have three pieces: a name, a body, and arguments. 

### Writing a Simple Function {-}

Let’s begin by taking an example of a relatively simple function. This function, called show_in_excel_penguins(), opens the data about penguins that we used in Chapter \@ref(rmarkdown-chapter) in Excel. We begin by importing the data with the `read_csv()` function before creating the `show_in_excel_penguins()` function:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
library(tidyverse)
library(fs)
```

Functions have three pieces: 

1. Name
1. Body
1. Arguments

Before we look at the `show_in_excel()` function, let's look at a slightly altered version to help us understand how functions work. This function, called `show_in_excel_penguins()` opens the data on penguins that we saw in \@ref(rmarkdown-chapter) in Excel. We begin by importing the data with the `read_csv()` function before creating the `show_in_excel_penguins()` function.

```{r echo = TRUE}
penguins <- read_csv("https://data.rwithoutstatistics.com/penguins-2007.csv")

show_in_excel_penguins <- function() {
  
  csv_file <- str_glue("{tempfile()}.csv")
  
  write_csv(x = penguins,
            file = csv_file,
            na = "")
  
  file_show(path = csv_file)
  
}
```

We load the tidyverse and fs packages. We’ll use tidyverse to create a filename for the CSV file and save it. The fs package will enable us to open the CSV file in Excel (or whichever program your computer uses to open CSV files by default).

We give the function a name, then use the assignment operator (`<-`) and `function()` to specify that `show_in_excel_penguins` is not a variable name but a function name. The open curly bracket (`{`) at the end of the line indicates the start of the function body, where the meat of the function can be found. In our case, the body does three things:

1. Creates a location for a CSV file to be saved using the str_glue() function combined with the tempfile() function. This creates a file at a temporary location with the *.csv* extension and saves it as `csv_file`.

1. Writes penguins to the location set in `csv_file`. The x argument in `write_csv()` refers to the data frame to be saved. We also make all `NA` values show up as blanks. By default, they will show up as the text *NA*.

1. Uses the `file_show()` function from the `fs` package to open the temporarily created CSV file in Excel.

If you wanted to use the `show_in_excel_penguins()` function, you would run the lines where you define the function. Highlight the lines where you define the function and hit command/control (Mac/Windows) and Enter at the same time and you will see the function show up in your global environment, as seen in Figure \@ref(fig:function-in-global-environment).

```{r results='asis'}
print_nostarch_file_name(file_type_to_print = "png")
```

```{r function-in-global-environment, out.width="100%", fig.cap="The function we created in the global environment"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("assets/function-in-global-environment.png"))
```

```{r results='asis'}
save_image_for_nostarch(here::here("assets/function-in-global-environment.png"))
```

From there on out, any time you run the code `show_in_excel_penguins()`, R will open up the penguins data frame in Excel.

### Adding Arguments {-}

Now, you’re probably thinking that the function we wrote doesn’t seem very useful. All it does it open the `penguins` data frame. Why would you want to keep doing that? A more practical function would let you open any data in Excel so you can use it in a variety of contexts. 

The `show_in_excel()` function takes any data frame from R, saves it as a CSV file, and opens the CSV file in Excel. Bruno Rodrigues, head of the Department of Statistics and Data Strategy at the Ministry of Higher Education and Research in Luxembourg, wrote it to easily share data with his non-R-user colleagues. Whenever he needed data in a CSV file, he could run his function.

To make such a function, we need to add arguments. Below is a slightly simplified version of the actual code that Bruno Rodrigues used. It looks the same as our `show_in_excel_penguins()` function, with two exceptions: 

```{r echo = TRUE}
show_in_excel <- function(data) {
  csv_file <- str_glue("{tempfile()}.csv")
  write_csv(x = data,
            file = csv_file,
            na = "")
  file_show(path = csv_file)
}
```

Notice that the first line now says `function(data)`. Items listed within the parentheses of our function definition are arguments. If you look further down, you’ll see another change. Within `write_csv()`, instead of `x = penguins`, we now use the line `x = data`. This allows us to use the function with any data, not just `penguins`.

To use this function, you would tell `show_in_excel()` what data to use, and the function would open the data in Excel. For example, you can tell it to open the `penguins` data frame as follows:

```{r echo = TRUE}
show_in_excel(data = penguins)
```

Having created the function with the `data` argument, we can run it with any data we want to. This code, for example, will import COVID case data we saw in Chapter \@ref(website-chapter) and open it in Excel:

```{r echo = TRUE}
covid_data <- read_csv("https://data.rwithoutstatistics.com/us-states-covid-rolling-average.csv")

show_in_excel(data = covid_data)
```

You can also use this function at the end of a pipeline. This code filters the `covid_data` data frame to include only data from California before opening it in Excel:

```{r}
covid_data %>% 
  filter(state == "California") %>% 
  show_in_excel()
```


Bruno Rodrigues could have copied the code within the `show_in_excel()` function and re-run it every time he wanted to view his data in Excel. But, by creating a function, he was able to write the code just once and then run it as many times as necessary.

## Creating a Function to Automatically Format Race and Ethnicity Data {-}

Let's look at one more function to make sure you understand how functions work. As we saw in Chapter \@ref(accessing-data-chapter), we can use the `tidycensus` package to easily pull in data directly from the United States Census Bureau. As we also saw in that same chapter, it can be hard to remember the names of variables. I regularly want to access data on population by race and ethnicity from the American Community Survey, but I never remember which variables I need to access to do so. I've created the `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` function to help me. I'll walk through its development step-by-step in order to show some important concepts about making functions.

A first version of this function might look like this. My `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` function calls the `get_acs()` function from `tidycensus`, getting data at the state level. Instead of returning the default output, it relabels the race and ethnicity groups from the hard-to-remember variable names to actual names, such as White and Black/African American. The `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` function saves the result of the `get_acs()` call as an object called `race_ethnicity_data`. And then, at the bottom of the function, the line with `race_ethnicity_data` on its own returns that data when the function is run. 

```{r echo = TRUE}
library(tidycensus)

get_acs_race_ethnicity <- function() {
  
  race_ethnicity_data <- get_acs(geography = "state",
                                 variables = c("White" = "B03002_003",
                                               "Black/African American" = "B03002_004",
                                               "American Indian/Alaska Native" = "B03002_005",
                                               "Asian" = "B03002_006",
                                               "Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander" = "B03002_007",
                                               "Other race" = "B03002_008",
                                               "Multi-Race" = "B03002_009",
                                               "Hispanic/Latino" = "B03002_012")) 
  
  race_ethnicity_data
  
}
```

Once I define this function, I can now run it in the future as follows:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
get_acs_race_ethnicity()
```

Doing so will return the data, with easy to read race and ethnicity group names.

```{r}
get_acs_race_ethnicity()
```

When I use this function, I sometimes like to have my variables names returned in a consistent syntax. To do this, I could use the `clean_names()` function from the `janitor` package, which makes all variable names use snake case (that is all words lower case and underscores between words). In our example above, I'd like to use the variable name `geoid` rather than `GEOID`. However, I want to leave myself the option to keep the original variable names. 
To do this, I need to add an argument to my function. Below, I've added the `clean_variable_names` argument to the `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` function. I've also specified that it should be `FALSE` by default. Then, in the function body, I set up an `if` statement. If the `clean_variable_names` argument is TRUE, the line `race_ethnicity_data <- clean_names(race_ethnicity_data)` is run, overwriting `race_ethnicity_data` with a version that has snake case names. If the `clean_variable_names` argument is FALSE, `race_ethnicity_data` is unchanged. 

```{r echo = TRUE}
get_acs_race_ethnicity <- function(clean_variable_names = FALSE) {
  
  race_ethnicity_data <- get_acs(geography = "state",
                                 variables = c("White" = "B03002_003",
                                               "Black/African American" = "B03002_004",
                                               "American Indian/Alaska Native" = "B03002_005",
                                               "Asian" = "B03002_006",
                                               "Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander" = "B03002_007",
                                               "Other race" = "B03002_008",
                                               "Multi-Race" = "B03002_009",
                                               "Hispanic/Latino" = "B03002_012")) 
  
  if (clean_variable_names == TRUE) {
    
    race_ethnicity_data <- clean_names(race_ethnicity_data)
    
  }
  
  race_ethnicity_data
  
}
```

If I run `get_acs_race_ethnicity()`, nothing will change because `clean_variable_names` is FALSE by default. However, if I want to set `clean_variable_names` to TRUE, I can do it as follows:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
get_acs_race_ethnicity(clean_variable_names = TRUE)
```

And this will return my data with clean variable names. 

```{r}
get_acs_race_ethnicity(clean_variable_names = TRUE)
```

Now that you've seen how to add arguments in both the `show_in_excel()` and `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` functions, let's talk about how you can pass arguments from the function you make to another function.

### Using `...` to Pass Arguments to Another Function {-}

In my `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` function above, I made a choice to get the data at the state level using `geography = "state"` within the `get_acs()` function. But what if I want to get the data at the county level? Or the census tract level? These are all possible with `get_acs()`, but I've written my `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` function in a way that is not flexible enough to allow this. 

Your first thought on how to do this might involve adding an additional argument for the geography. Something like the code below, which adds a `my_geography` argument and then uses it within the `get_acs()` function. 

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
get_acs_race_ethnicity <- function(clean_variable_names = FALSE,
                                   my_geography) {
  
  race_ethnicity_data <- get_acs(geography = my_geography,
                                 variables = c("White" = "B03002_003",
                                               "Black/African American" = "B03002_004",
                                               "American Indian/Alaska Native" = "B03002_005",
                                               "Asian" = "B03002_006",
                                               "Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander" = "B03002_007",
                                               "Other race" = "B03002_008",
                                               "Multi-Race" = "B03002_009",
                                               "Hispanic/Latino" = "B03002_012")) 
  
  if (clean_variable_names == TRUE) {
    
    race_ethnicity_data <- clean_names(race_ethnicity_data)
    
  }
  
  race_ethnicity_data
  
}
```

But what if I want to also select the year? Well, I could add an argument for that as well. As we saw in Chapter \@ref(accessing-data-chapter), the `get_acs()` function has many arguments. I don't want to repeat them all as arguments in my `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` function, and the `...` allows us to avoid doing so. By putting `...` in the `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` function, any arguments listed there are then passed to the `get_acs()` function (note the `...` there as well). 

```{r echo = TRUE}
get_acs_race_ethnicity <- function(clean_variable_names = FALSE,
                                   ...) {
  
  race_ethnicity_data <- get_acs(...,
                                 variables = c("White" = "B03002_003",
                                               "Black/African American" = "B03002_004",
                                               "American Indian/Alaska Native" = "B03002_005",
                                               "Asian" = "B03002_006",
                                               "Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander" = "B03002_007",
                                               "Other race" = "B03002_008",
                                               "Multi-Race" = "B03002_009",
                                               "Hispanic/Latino" = "B03002_012")) 
  
  if (clean_variable_names == TRUE) {
    
    race_ethnicity_data <- clean_names(race_ethnicity_data)
    
  }
  
  race_ethnicity_data
  
}
```

I can then run this code to set the `geography` to state. 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
get_acs_race_ethnicity(geography = "state")
```

Which would return the following:

```{r}
get_acs_race_ethnicity(geography = "state")
```

Or I could switch this to get data by counties. 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
get_acs_race_ethnicity(geography = "state")
```

Which would return the following:

```{r}
get_acs_race_ethnicity(geography = "county")
```

I could also run my `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` function again and add `geometry = TRUE` as follows. 

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
get_acs_race_ethnicity(geography = "county",
                       geometry = TRUE)
```

My `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` function will now return geospatial data alongside my demographic data. 

```{r}
get_acs_race_ethnicity(geography = "state",
                       geometry = TRUE,
                       progress_bar = FALSE)
```

The `...` allows me to create my own function and pass any arguments from it to another function without repeating all of the child function's arguments. This gives me flexibility while maintaining brevity.

Now that we've discussed how to make functions, let's talk about how to put them into a package. 

## How to Create a Package {-}

Packages bundle your functions so you can use them in multiple projects. If you find yourself copying functions from one project to another, or perhaps have a set of functions you’ve saved in a `functions.R` file that you copy into each new project, these are good indications that you should make a package. 

While you can run the functions from a `functions.R` file in your own environment, this code in may not work on someone else’s computer. Other users may not have the necessary packages installed, or they may be confused about how your functions’ arguments work and not know where to go for help. If you put your functions in a package, they are more likely to work, as they include necessary dependencies. R packages also contain built-in documentation to help them use the functions on their own.

The `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` function I made is an example of this. I can use it in any project where I need race and ethnicity data.

### Starting the Package {-}

To create a package in RStudio, go to the File menu, then select New Project. From there, select New Directory. You'll be given a list of options, one of which is R Package. Select it, and give your package a name. In Figure \@ref(fig:rstudio-create-package) I've called mine `dk`. Also decide where you want it to live on your computer. You can leave everything else as is.

```{r results='asis'}
print_nostarch_file_name(file_type_to_print = "png")
```

```{r rstudio-create-package, out.width="100%", fig.cap="The RStudio menu for creating your package"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("assets/create-r-package.png"))
```

```{r results='asis'}
save_image_for_nostarch(here::here("assets/create-r-package.png"))
```

RStudio will now create and open the package. It should already contain a few files, including `hello.R`, which has a pre-built function called `hello()` that, when run, prints the text “Hello, world!” in the console. Let’s get rid of it and a few other default files so we can start with a clean slate. Delete *hello.R*, *NAMESPACE*, and *hello.Rd* in the *man* directory.

### Adding Functions with `use_r()` {-}

All functions in a package should go in separate files in the *R* folder. To add these files to the package automatically and test that they work correctly, we’ll use the `usethis` and `devtools` packages. Install them using `install.packages()` if you don’t already have them installed:

```{r echo = TRUE}
install.packages("usethis")
install.packages("devtools")
```

To add a function to the package, run the `use_r()` function from the usethis package in the console. 

```{r}
usethis::use_r("acs")
```

The `package::function()` syntax makes it possible to use the function without loading the package. This function should create a file called `acs.R` in the R directory with the name you give it as an argument. The name of the file itself doesn't really matter, but choosing something that gives an indication of the functions within it is good practice. Now you can open the file and add code to it. Copy the `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` function to the package.

### Checking our Package with `devtools` {-}

We need to change the `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` in a few ways to make it work in a package. The easiest way to figure out what changes we need to make is to use built-in tools to check that our package is built correctly. Run the function `devtools::check()` in the console to perform what is known as R CMD check, which makes sure that others can install your package on their system. Running `R CMD check` on the `dk` package gives us a long message. The last part is the most important:

```

0 errors ✔ | 2 warnings ✖ | 1 note ✖
```

Let's review the output from bottom to top. The line "0 errors ✔ | 2 warnings ✖ | 1 note ✖" gives us the three levels of issues with our package. Errors are the most severe, as they mean others won’t be able to install your package, while warnings and notes may cause problems for others. It’s best practice to eliminate all errors, warnings, and notes. 

Let’s start with the note at 1. To understand what `R CMD check` is saying, we need to explain a bit about how packages work. When you install a package using the `install.packages()` function, it often takes a while. That’s because, while you are telling R to install one package, that single package likely uses functions from other packages. In order to have access to these functions, R will install these packages (known as dependencies) for you. It would be a pain if, every time you installed package, you had to manually install a whole set of dependencies. But in order to make sure that the appropriate packages are installed for any users of the `dk` package, we have to make a few changes.

When we run `R CMD check`, we are told that we have several “Undefined global functions or variables” and “no visible global function definition” for various functions. This is because we are attempting to use functions from the `tidycensus` and `janitor` packages, but we haven’t specified that these functions are from `tidycensus` and `janitor` I can use this code because I have `tidycensus` and `janitor` installed, but we can’t assume that others will have them installed. 

### Adding Dependency Packages {-}

To ensure the package’s code will work, we need to install `tidycensus` and `janitor` for users when they install the `dk` package. To do this, run the `use_package()` function from the `usethis` package in the console:

```{r eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
usethis::use_package(package = "tidycensus")
```

You should get the following message:

```
✔ Setting active project to '/Users/davidkeyes/Documents/Work/R Without Statistics/dk'
✔ Adding 'tidycensus' to Imports field in DESCRIPTION
• Refer to functions with `tidycensus::fun()`
```

You'll then need to run `usethis::use_package(package = "tidycensus")`, which should give you the following output:

```
✔ Adding 'janitor' to Imports field in DESCRIPTION
• Refer to functions with `janitor::fun()`
```

The "Setting active project ..." line tells me that it is working in the `dk` project. The second line in both outputs tells me that the *DESCRIPTION* file has been edited. This file provides meta information about the package we’re developing. If you open the *DESCRIPTION* file in the root directory of your project, you should see the following:

```

```

Look for the imports way down at the bottom of the file. This indicates that, when a user installs the `dk` package, the `tidycensus` and `janitor` packages will also be installed for them. 

### Referring to Functions Correctly {-}

The R CMD check output also included this line: “Refer to functions with `ggplot2::fun()`”. This tells us that, in order to use functions from other packages in the `dk` package, we need to specifying both the package name and the function name to ensure that the correct function is used at all times. In rare occasions, you’ll find functions with identical names used across multiple packages, and this syntax avoids ambiguity. Remember when we ran `R CMD check` and got this?

```
Undefined global functions or variables:
clean_names get_acs
```

This is because we were using functions without saying what package they come from. The `clean_names()` function comes from the `janitor` package and `get_acs()` comes from `tidycensus` so I need to add the package names before each in my function. 

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
get_acs_race_ethnicity <- function(clean_variable_names = FALSE,
                                   ...) {
  
  race_ethnicity_data <- tidycensus::get_acs(...,
                                             variables = c("White" = "B03002_003",
                                                           "Black/African American" = "B03002_004",
                                                           "American Indian/Alaska Native" = "B03002_005",
                                                           "Asian" = "B03002_006",
                                                           "Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander" = "B03002_007",
                                                           "Other race" = "B03002_008",
                                                           "Multi-Race" = "B03002_009",
                                                           "Hispanic/Latino" = "B03002_012")) 
  
  if (clean_variable_names == TRUE) {
    
    race_ethnicity_data <- janitor::clean_names(race_ethnicity_data)
    
  }
  
  race_ethnicity_data
  
}
```

Now that I've specified the packages the functions come from, I can run `devtools::check()` again. When I do so, I now see that the notes have gone away. 

```

Extensions’ manual.

0 errors ✔ | 2 warnings ✖ | 0 notes ✔
```

However, I can see that there are still two warnings that I need to deal with. Let's do that next.

### Adding Documentation {-}

Take a look at the “checking for missing documentation entries” warning. This warning tells us that we need to add documentation of the `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` function. One of the benefits of creating a package is that you can add documentation to help others use your code. In the same way that users can enter `?get_acs()` and see documentation about that function, we want them to be able to enter `?get_acs_race_ethnicity()` to learn how it works.

To create documentation for `get_acs_race_ethnicity()`, we’ll use Roxygen, a way to document functions in R packages using a package called `roxygen2.` To get started, place your cursor anywhere in the function. Then, go to the **Code** menu in RStudio and select **Insert Roxygen Skeleton**. Doing this should add text above the `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` function that looks like this:

Doing this will add some text above the `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` function that looks like this: 

```
#' Title
#'
#' @param clean_variable_names 
#' @param ... 
#'
#' @return
#' @export
#'
#' @examples
```

This text is the documentation’s skeleton. Each line starts with the special characters `#'`, which indicate we’re working with Roxygen. We can now edit the text to create our documentation. Begin by replacing `Title` with a sentence that describes the function:

```
#' Access race and ethnicity data from the American Community Survey
```

Next, you can see lines with the text `@param`. Roxygen automatically looks at the arguments in our function and creates a line for each one. 

Next are lines beginning with the text `@param`. Roxygen automatically locates the arguments in the function and creates a line for each one. On the first line, we describe what the `clean_variable_names` argument does. On the second, we specify that the `...` will pass additional arguments to the `tidycensus::get_acs()` function. 

```
#' @param clean_variable_names Should variable names be cleaned (i.e. snake case)
#' @param ... Other arguments passed to tidycensus::get_acs()
```

The `@return` line should tell the user what the `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` function returns. In our case, it returns data, which I document as follows:

```
#' @return A tibble with five variables: GEOID, NAME, variable, estimate, and moe
```

Below `@return` is `@export`. We don’t need to change anything here. Most functions in a package are known as *exported functions*, meaning they are available to users of the package. In contrast, internal functions, which are only used by the package developers, do not have `@export` in the Roxygen skeleton.

The last section is `@examples`. This is where you can give examples of code that users can run to learn how the function works. Doing this introduces some complexity and isn’t required, so we’ll skip it here. If you do want to learn more, the second edition of Hadley Wickham and Jenny Bryan’s book *R Packages* is a great place to learn about adding examples.

Now that we’ve added the documentation with Roxygen, run `devtools::document()` in the console. This will create a `get_acs_race_ethnicity.Rd` documentation file in the *man* directory using the very specific format that R packages require You’re welcome to look at it, but you can’t change it, since it is read only.

Running the function should also create a *NAMESPACE* file, which lists the functions that your package makes available to users. It should look like this:

```
# Generated by roxygen2: do not edit by hand

export(get_acs_race_ethnicity)
```

The `get_acs_race_ethnicity()` function is now almost ready for users. 

### Adding a License and Metadata {-}

Try running `devtools::check()` again to see if we’ve fixed the issues that led to the warnings. The warning about missing documentation should no longer be there. However, we do still have one warning:

```
❯ checking DESCRIPTION meta-information ... WARNING
Non-standard license specification:
What license is it under?
Standardizable: FALSE

0 errors ✔ | 1 warning ✖ | 0 notes ✔
```

This warning tells us that we haven’t given our package a license. If you plan to make your package publicly available, choosing a license is important because it tells other people what they can and cannot do with your code. For information about how to choose the right license for your package, see *https://choosealicense.com/*. 

In this example, we use the MIT license. which allows people to do essentially whatever they want with your code, by running `usethis::use_mit_license()`. The `usethis` package has similar functions for other common licenses. Doing so returns the following:

```
✔ Setting active project to '/Users/davidkeyes/Documents/Work/R Without Statistics/dk'
✔ Setting License field in DESCRIPTION to 'MIT + file LICENSE'
✔ Writing 'LICENSE'
✔ Writing 'LICENSE.md'
✔ Adding '^LICENSE\\.md$' to '.Rbuildignore'
```

The `use_mit_license()` function handles a lot of the tedious parts of adding a license to our package. Most importantly for us, it specifies the license in the *DESCRIPTION* file. If you open it, you should see a confirmation that you’ve added the MIT license:

```
License: MIT + file LICENSE
```

In addition to the license, the *DESCRIPTION* file contains metadata about the package. We can make a few changes to change the title and add an author, a maintainer, and a description. The final *DESCRIPTION* file might look something like this:

```
Package: dk
Type: Package
Title: David Keyes's Personal Package
Version: 0.1.0
Author: David Keyes
Maintainer: David Keyes <david@rfortherestofus.com>
Description: A package with functions that David Keyes may find 
useful.
License: MIT + file LICENSE
Encoding: UTF-8
LazyData: true
Imports:
ggplot2
```

Having made these changes, let's run `devtools::check()` one more time to make sure everything is in order:

```
0 errors ✔ | 0 warnings ✔ | 0 notes ✔
```

We get exactly what we hoped to see.

### Adding Additional Functions {-}

You’ve now got a package with one working function in it. If you wanted to add additional functions, you would follow the same procedure:

1. Create a new *.R* file with `usethis::use_r()` or copy another function to the existing *.R* file.

1. Develop your function using the `package::function()` syntax to refer to functions from other packages.

1. Add any dependency packages with `use_package()`.

1. Add documentation of your function.

1. Run `devtools::check()` to make sure you did everything correctly.

Your package can contain a single function, like dk, or as many functions as you want.


### Installing the Package {-}

Having developed the package, we’re now ready to install and use it. When you’re developing your own package, installing it for your own use is relatively straightforward. Simply run `devtools::install()` and the package will be ready for you to use in any project.

Of course, if you’re developing a package, you’re likely doing it not just for yourself, but for others as well. The most common way to make your package available to others is with the code-sharing website GitHub. The details of how to put your code on GitHub are beyond what we can cover here, but the book *Happy Git and GitHub for the useR* by Jenny Bryan is a great place to get started. 

I’ve pushed the `dk` package to GitHub, and you can find it at https://github.com/dgkeyes/dk. If you or anyone else wants to install it, first make sure you have the `remotes` package installed. This package, which can be installed by running `install.packages("remotes")`, allows you to install packages from a wide range of locations, including GitHub. Once you've installed the `remotes` package, you can run the code `remotes::install_github("dgkeyes/dk")` in the console to install the `dk` package. 

## In Conclusion: You're Already Ready to Make Your Own R Package {-}

Packages are useful because they let you bundle several elements needed to reliably run your code: a set of functions, instructions to automatically install dependency packages, and code documentation. 

Creating your own R package is especially beneficial when you’re working for an organization, as they can allow advanced R users to help those with less experience. When Gerke and Aden-Buie provided researchers at the Moffitt Cancer Center with a package that contained functions for easily accessing their databases, the researchers began use R more creatively. 

If you create a package, you can also guide people to use R in the way you think is best. Packages are a way to ensure that others follow best practices (without even being aware they are doing so). They make it easy to reuse functions across projects, help others, and adhere to a consistent style.
