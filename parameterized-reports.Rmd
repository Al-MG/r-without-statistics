# Using Parameters to Automate Reports {#parameterized-reports-chapter}

*Parameterized reporting* is a technique that uses R Markdown to make multiple reports simultaneously. Using parameterized reporting, you can follow the same process to make 3,000 reports as you did to make one report. The technique also makes your work more accurate, as it avoids copy-and-paste errors.  

For example, staff at the Urban Institute, a think tank based in Washington, DC, used parameterized reporting to develop fiscal briefs for all US states, as well as the District of Columbia. Each report required extensive text and multiple charts, so creating them by hand wasn’t feasible. Instead, employees Safia Sayed, Livia Mucciolo, and Aaron Williams automated the process. Their 51 beautiful reports appeared on the Urban Institute website. A snippet is shown in Figure \@ref(fig:state-fiscal-briefs).

```{r results='asis'}
print_nostarch_file_name(file_type_to_print = "png")
```

```{r state-fiscal-briefs, out.width="100%", fig.cap="Figure 1-1	An excerpt from the state fiscal briefs"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("assets/state-fiscal-briefs.png"))
```

```{r results='asis'}
save_image_for_nostarch(here::here("assets/state-fiscal-briefs.png"))
```

This chapter explains what parameterized reporting is, then works through a simplified version of the code that the Urban Institute used. 

## How Parameterized Reporting Works {-}

If you’ve ever had to make multiple reports at the same time, you know what a drag it can be, especially if you’re using the multi-tool workflow described in Chapter \@ref(rmarkdown-chapter). Making just one report can take a long time. Take that work and multiply it by 10, 20, or, in the case of the team at the Urban Institute, 51, and it can start to feel overwhelming. Parameterized reporting can generate thousands of reports at once using the following workflow:

1. Make a report template in R Markdown

2. Add a parameter (for example, one representing US states) in the YAML of your R Markdown document to represent the values that will change between reports

3. Use that parameter to generate a report for one state, to make sure you can knit your document

4. Create a separate R script file that sets the value of the parameter and then knits a report

5. Run this script for all states

Let’s begin by creating a report template for one state. To do this, I’ve taken the code that the Urban Institute staff used to make their state fiscal briefs and simplified it significantly. Instead of focusing on fiscal data, I’ve used data you may be more familiar with: COVID-19 rates from mid-2022. Here is the R Markdown document:

````{verbatim echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, lang = "markdown"}
---
title: "Urban Institute COVID Report"
output: html_document
params:
state: "Alabama"
---
  
  ```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  echo = FALSE,
  warning = FALSE,
  message = FALSE
)
```

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(urbnthemes)
library(here)
library(scales)
```

# `r params$state`

```{r}
cases <- tibble(state.name) %>%
  rbind(state.name = "District of Columbia") %>%
  left_join(
    read_csv("united_states_covid19_cases_deaths_and_testing_by_state.csv",
      skip = 2
    ),
    by = c("state.name" = "State/Territory")
  ) %>%
  select(
    total_cases = `Total Cases`, state.name,
    cases_per_100000 = `Case Rate per 100000`
  ) %>%
  mutate(cases_per_100000 = parse_number(cases_per_100000)) %>%
  mutate(case_rank = rank(-cases_per_100000, ties.method = "min"))
```

```{r}
state_text <- if_else(params$state == "District of Columbia", str_glue("the District of Columbia"), str_glue("state of {params$state}"))

state_cases_per_100000 <- cases %>%
  filter(state.name == params$state) %>%
  pull(cases_per_100000) %>%
  comma()

state_cases_rank <- cases %>%
  filter(state.name == params$state) %>%
  pull(case_rank)
```

In `r state_text`, there were `r state_cases_per_100000` cases per 100,000 people in the last seven days. This puts `r params$state` at number `r state_cases_rank` of 50 states and the District of Columbia. 

```{r fig.height = 8}
set_urbn_defaults(style = "print")

cases %>%
  mutate(highlight_state = if_else(state.name == params$state, "Y", "N")) %>%
  mutate(state.name = fct_reorder(state.name, cases_per_100000)) %>%
  ggplot(aes(
    x = cases_per_100000,
    y = state.name,
    fill = highlight_state
  )) +
  geom_col() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = comma_format()) +
  theme(legend.position = "none") +
  labs(
    y = NULL,
    x = "Cases per 100,000"
  )
```
````

The text and charts in the report come from the `cases` data frame, shown here:

```{r}
cases
```

If we knit this document, we end up with a simple HTML document, seen in Figure \@ref(fig:alabama-covid-report).

```{r results='asis'}
print_nostarch_file_name(file_type_to_print = "png")
```

```{r alabama-covid-report, out.width="100%", fig.cap="A screenshot of the Alabama COVID report"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("assets/alabama-covid-report.png"))
```

```{r results='asis'}
save_image_for_nostarch(here::here("assets/alabama-covid-report.png"))
```

The R Markdown document’s YAML, R code chunks, inline code, and Markdown text should look familiar if you’ve read Chapter \@ref(rmarkdown-chapter). 

### Using Parameters {-}

In R Markdown, *parameters* are variables that we set in the YAML to allow us to create multiple reports. Take a look at these two lines in the YAML:


````{verbatim echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, lang = "markdown"}
params:
  state: "Alabama"
````

This code defines a variable, in this case state. We can then use this variable throughout the rest of the R Markdown document using this syntax: params$variable_name, replacing variable_name with state or any name you set in the YAML. For example, take a look at this inline R code:

````{verbatim echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, lang = "markdown"}
# `r params$state`
````

Any instance of `params$state` will be converted to "Alabama" when we knit it. The line shown here becomes the first-level heading visible in Figure \@ref(fig:alabama-covid-report). This parameter shows up again in the following code:

````{verbatim echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE, lang = "markdown"}
In `r state_text`, there were `r state_cases_per_100000` cases per 100,000 people in the last seven days. This puts `r params$state` at number `r state_cases_rank` of 50 states and the District of Columbia. 
````

When we knit the document, we see the following text:

> In the state of Alabama, there were 26,573 cases per 100,000 people in the last seven days. This puts Alabama at number 18 of 50 states and the District of Columbia.

This text is automatically generated. The inline R code `` `r knitr::inline_expr("state_text")` `` prints the value of the variable `state_text`. And `state_text` is determined by this `if_else()` statement:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
state_text <- if_else(params$state == "District of Columbia", str_glue("the District of Columbia"), str_glue("state of {params$state}"))
```

If the value of `params$states` is the District of Columbia, this code makes state_text equal to "the District of Columbia". If `params$state` does not equal District of Columbia, then `state_text` gets the value "state of", followed by the state name. This allows us to put `state_text` in a sentence and have it work no matter whether our state parameter is a state or the District of Columbia.

## Generating Numbers with Parameters {-}

We can also use parameters to generate numeric values to include in the text. For example, we calculate the values of the `state_cases_per_100000` and `state_cases_rank` variables dynamically using the `state` parameter, as shown here: 

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
state_cases_per_100000 <- cases %>%
  filter(state.name == params$state) %>%
  pull(cases_per_100000) %>%
  comma()

state_cases_rank <- cases %>%
  filter(state.name == params$state) %>%
  pull(case_rank)
```

We filter the `cases` data frame (which contains data for all states) to keep just the data for the state in `params$state`. We then use the `pull()` function to get a single value from that data, and format it with the `comma()` function from the scales package to make `state_cases_per_100000` show up as 26,573 (rather than 26573) before putting these variables into the inline R code.

### Creating Visualizations Based on Parameters {-}

We can see the parameter used in other places as well, such as to highlight a state in the report’s bar chart. To see how we accomplish this, take a look at the following section from the last code chunk: 

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
cases %>%
  mutate(highlight_state = if_else(state.name == params$state, "Y", "N"))
```

This code creates a variable called `highlight_state`. Within the `cases` data frame, we check whether `state.name` is equal to `params$state`. If it is, `highlight_state` gets the value `Y`. If not, it gets `N`. Here is what the relevant columns in the data look like after we run these two lines:

```{r}
cases %>%
  mutate(highlight_state = if_else(state.name == params$state, "Y", "N")) %>%
  select(state.name, highlight_state)
```

Later, the ggplot code uses the highlight_state variable for the bar chart’s fill aesthetic, highlighting the state in params$state in yellow and coloring the other states blue. Figure \@ref(fig:alabama-covid-chart) shows the chart with Alabama highlighted.

```{r results='asis'}
print_nostarch_file_name(file_type_to_print = "png")
```

```{r alabama-covid-chart, out.width="100%", fig.cap="A bar chart showing Alabama highlighted"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("assets/alabama-covid-chart.png"))
```

```{r results='asis'}
save_image_for_nostarch(here::here("assets/alabama-covid-chart.png"))
```

You’ve seen how setting a parameter in the YAML gives us the ability to dynamically generate text and charts in the knitted report. But we’ve only generated one report so far. How can we create all 51 reports? Your first thought might be to manually update the YAML by changing the parameter’s value from Alabama to, say, Alaska, then knitting the document again. While you could follow this process for all states, it would be tedious, and we’re trying to avoid tedium. Let’s automate the report generation instead.

## Creating an R Script {-}

To automatically generate multiple reports based on the template we created, we’ll use an R script that changes the value of the parameters in the R Markdown document and then knits it. Begin by creating an R script file named `render.R`. 

### Knitting the Document Using Code {-}

Our script needs the ability to knit an R Markdown document. While you’ve seen how to do this using the Knit button, you can do the same thing with code. Load the `rmarkdown` package and then use its `render()` function, as shown here:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
library(rmarkdown)

render(
  input = "urban-covid-budget-report.Rmd",
  output_file = "Alaska.html",
  params = list(state = "Alaska")
)
```

This function generates an HTML document called *urban-covid-budget-report.html*. By default, the generated file has the same name as the R Markdown document, with a different extension. We change its name by using the `output_file` argument. We also tell `render()` to use parameters we give it. These parameters will override those in the R Markdown document itself. For example, the code we’ve written would tell R to use Alaska for the `state` parameter and save the resulting HTML file as *Alaska.html*.

This approach to generating reports works, but to get all 51 reports, we’d have to manually change the state name in the YAML and update the `render()` function before we run it for each report. In the next section, we’ll update our code to do so more efficiently.

#### Creating a Tibble with Parameter Data {-}

Let’s write code that generates all reports for us automatically. First, we must create a *vector* (in colloquial terms, a list of items) of all state names and the District of Columbia. To do this, we’ll use the built-in dataset *state.name*, which has all 50 state names in a vector:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
state <- tibble(state.name) %>%
  rbind("District of Columbia") %>%
  pull(state.name)
```

We turn it into a tibble and then use the `rbind()` function to add the District of Columbia to the list. Finally, we use the `pull()` function to get one single column and save this as `state`. Here is what the `state` vector looks like:

```{r}
state
```

Rather than use `render()` with the `input` and `output_file` arguments, as we did earlier, we can pass it the `params` argument to give it parameters to use when knitting. Let’s create a tibble with the information needed to render all 51 reports and save it as an object called `reports`, which we’ll pass to the `render()` function: 

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = TRUE}
reports <- tibble(
  input = "urban-covid-budget-report.Rmd",
  output_file = str_glue("{state}.html"),
  params = map(state, ~ list(state = .))
)
```

This code generates a tibble with 51 rows and three variables. In all rows, we set the `input` variable to the name of the R Markdown document. We set the value of `output_file` with `str_glue()` to be equal to the name of the state, followed by .html (for example, *Alabama.html*). 

The `params` variable is the most complicated of the three. It is what’s known as a named list. This data structure puts the data in the `state: state_name` format needed for the R Markdown document’s YAML. We use the `map()` function from the purrr package to create the named list, telling R to set the value of each row as `state = "Alabama"`, then `state =  "Alaska"`, and so on, for all states. If you look at the `reports` tibble, you can see these variables:

```{r}
reports
```

The params variable shows up as <named list>, but if you open the tibble in the RStudio viewer by clicking reports in your Environment tab, you can see the output more clearly (Figure \@ref(fig:params-named-list)).

```{r results='asis'}
print_nostarch_file_name(file_type_to_print = "png")
```

```{r params-named-list, out.width="100%", fig.cap="The named list column shown in the RStudio viewer"}
knitr::include_graphics(here::here("assets/params-named-list.png"))
```

```{r results='asis'}
save_image_for_nostarch(here::here("assets/params-named-list.png"))
```

This view allows us to see the named list in the `params` variable, with the `state` variable equal to the name of each state. 

Once we’ve created the `reports` tibble, we’re ready to render the reports. The code to do so is only one line long: 

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
pwalk(reports, render)
```

We use the `pwalk()` function from the `purrr` package. This function has two arguments: a data frame or tibble (`reports`, in our case), and a function that runs for each row of this tibble, (`render()`). Note that we do not include open and closing parentheses when passing this function name to `pwalk()`.

Running this code runs the `render()` function for each row in reports, passing in the values for `input`, `output_file`, and `params.` It is the equivalent of entering code like the following to run the `render()` function for each of the 51 states:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
render(
  input = "urban-covid-budget-report.Rmd",
  output_file = "Alabama.html",
  params = list(state = "Alabama")
)

render(
  input = "urban-covid-budget-report.Rmd",
  output_file = "Alaska.html",
  params = list(state = "Alaska")
)

render(
  input = "urban-covid-budget-report.Rmd",
  output_file = "Arizona.html",
  params = list(state = "Arizona")
)
```

Here is what the full R script file looks like:

```{r echo = TRUE, eval = FALSE}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(rmarkdown)

# Create a vector of all states and the District of Columbia
state <- tibble(state.name) %>%
  rbind("District of Columbia") %>%
  pull(state.name)

# Create a tibble with information on the:
# input R Markdown document
# output HTML file
# parameters needed to knit the document
reports <- tibble(
  input = "urban-covid-budget-report.Rmd",
  output_file = str_glue("{state}.html"),
  params = map(state, ~ list(state = .))
)

# Generate all of our reports
pwalk(reports, render)
```

If you run the `pwalk(reports, render)` code, you should see 51 HTML documents appear in the files panel in RStudio. Each one should consist of a report for that state, complete with a customized graph and accompanying text.

## Best Practices {-}

While powerful, parameterized reporting can also present some challenges. For example, make sure to consider outliers in your data. In the case of the state reports, Washington DC is an outlier because it is not technically a state. The Urban Institute team altered the language in the report text so that it didn’t refer to Washington DC as a state by using an `if_else()` statement, as you saw in this chapter.

Another best practice is to manually generate and review the reports whose parameter values have the shortest and longest text lengths. In the state fiscal briefs, these include Iowa, Ohio, or Utah and the District of Columbia. Reviewing these reports manually allows you to identify places where the length of the text may cause unexpected results, such as titles in charts being cut off, page breaks disrupted up by text that runs onto multiple lines, and so on. A few minutes of manual review can make the automated process of generating multiple reports much smoother.


## Conclusion {-}

In this chapter, we recreated the Urban Institute’s state fiscal briefs using parameterized reporting. You learned how to add a parameter to your R Markdown document, then use an R script to set the value of that parameter and knit the report. 

Automating the production of reports can be a huge time-saver, especially as the number of reports to generate grows. Consider another project at the Urban Institute: making county-level reports. With over 3,000 counties in the United States, making these reports by hand is not realistic. Additionally, if the Urban Institute were to make its reports using SPSS, Excel, and Word, they would have to copy and paste values between programs. Humans are fallible, and mistakes occur, no matter how hard we try to avoid them. Computers, on the other hand, do not make copy-and-paste errors. Letting computers handle the tedious work of making multiple reports significantly reduces the chance of error. 

When you’re starting out, parameterized reporting might feel like a heavy lift, as you have to make sure that your code works for all versions of your report. But once you have your R Markdown document and accompanying R script file, you’ll find it easy to produce multiple reports at once, saving you work in the end.
