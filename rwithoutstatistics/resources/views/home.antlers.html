       <p>Since R was invented in 1993, it has become a widely used programming language for statistical analysis. From academia to the tech world and beyond, R is used for a wide range of statistical analysis.</p> 

       <p>R's ubiquity in the world of statistics leads many to assume that it is only useful to those who do complex statistical work. But as R has grown in popularity, the number of ways it can be used has grown as well. Today, R is used for:</p>

       <ul>

       <li>Data visualization</li>
<li>Map making</li>
<li>Sharing results through reports, slides, and websites</li>
<li>Automating processes</li>
<li>And much more!</li>

</ul>

<p>The idea that R is only for statistical analysis is outdated and inaccurate. But, without a single book that demonstrates the power of R for non-statistical purposes, this perception persists.</p>

<p class="font-bold">Enter R Without Statistics.</p>

<p>R Without Statistics will show ways that R can be used beyond complex statistical analysis. Readers will learn about a range of uses for R, many of which they have likely never even considered. </p>

<p>Each chapter will, using a consistent format, cover one novel way of using R.</p>

<ol>

<li>Readers will first be introduced to an R user who has done something novel and learn how using R in this way transformed their work.</li> 
<li>Following this, there will be code samples that demonstrate exactly how the R user did the thing they are being profiled for.</li>
<li>Finally, there will be a summary, with lessons learned from this novel way of using R.</li>

</ol>

<p>R Without Statistics will be published by <a href="https://nostarch.com/">No Starch Press</a>.
